I have had to completely restructure my approach to solving this problem.
I have loaded both the Train and Test Sets of the Tanzanian Water Study to my Jupyter Notebook and run the following algorithms against these:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
After running these classifiers, I ran the data through the model and made predictions based on the highest accuracy score.
The best score was from using the Random Forest classifier with grid search.
I found out through trial and error that this was the only way to get results uploaded to the “Drivendata.org” – Pump It Up submission location. 
This was done by creating a “Prediction” group from the Test Set of data.
This is seen in the MOD4 Jupyter Notebook upload to my GitHub account.
So far, the best score that I have gotten is just over 52% with Random Forest.
The next modification I plan will use KNN as an algorithm, hopefully, this will produce additional positive results.
