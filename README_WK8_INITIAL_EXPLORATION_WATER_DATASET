DATA612 WEEK 8 INITIAL EXPLORATION OF TANZANIAN WATER DATASET – BRADLEY, ORREN
ITEMS
1.	Created account on Drivendata.org Website for competition on the Tanzanian “Pump-it-Up” water project.
URL:  
2.	I uploaded the datasets to my GitHub Account so that I could access them via my Jupyter Notebook.
3.	I uploaded the dataset to Jupyter and began to explore and play with the data. I have several versions to my Jupyter Notebook for this set. 
4.	I modified the CSV file to get better results, but I have hit a roadblock with various errors trying to run my initial Logistic Regression algorithm against the dataset. This can be seen in the GitHub upload for week eights work. I have also posted a README file outlining the same text that I have submitted here in this word document to Blue Quil.

5.	I will approach the problem from a different angle during Week 9s exploration of the water dataset.
