DATA612 WEEK 9 CONTINUING EXPLORATION OF TANZANIAN WATER DATASET – BRADLEY, ORREN
ITEMS
1.	I created an account on Drivendata.org Website for competition on the Tanzanian “Pump-it-Up” water project.

2.	I modified the dataset to replace object values with integer values. I uploaded the modified datasets to my GitHub account so that I could access them via my Jupyter Notebook.
3.	I uploaded the dataset to Jupyter and began to explore and play with the modified data. I have several versions of my Jupyter Notebook for this set. 
4.	I modified the CSV file to get better results, I have now been able to run the Logistic Regression modeling algorithm and Decision Tree modeling algorithm against the Tanzanian Water dataset without error codes. The initial results and accuracy scores were interesting. I have gotten a tuned accuracy result of nearly 60% with the Logistic Regression model and above 70% with the Decision Tree Classification Model.

5.	I will add additional algorithm models this coming week and attempt to use a ROC curve to show the results of the three classifiers used in the modeling.
